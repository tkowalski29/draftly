## Atomic Design Structure

Atoms (Basic UI elements)
â”œâ”€â”€ Icons - Simple colored rectangles representing icons
â”œâ”€â”€ Inputs - Form input fields with labels
â””â”€â”€ Badges - Small status/category labels

Molecules (Component combinations)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Cards - Content cards with images, titles, descriptions
â””â”€â”€ Form Fields - Complete form inputs with validation states

Organisms (Complex sections)
â”œâ”€â”€ Headers - Navigation headers with logo, menu, actions
â””â”€â”€ Product Grids - Responsive product displays with cards
```

## Customization

Each example can be customized by modifying:
- **Colors**: Change hex color values in `fills` properties
- **Spacing**: Adjust `padding` and `spacing` in `autoLayout`
- **Content**: Update `text`, `title`, `description` fields
- **Sizing**: Modify `width`, `height`, and component dimensions
- **Layout**: Change `direction` and `alignment` in `autoLayout`

## Tips

- Start with `design-system.json` to understand all components
- Use `landing-page.json` for marketing pages
- Use `shopping-cart.json` for e-commerce interfaces
- Mix and match components to create custom layouts
- All examples use the Inter font family for consistency

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that all required fonts are available in Figma
2. Ensure your JSON syntax is valid
3. Verify that component properties match the expected structure
4. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
